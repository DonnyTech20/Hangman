Hangman game in JavaScript:

This is the classic Hangman game where the player is given a word and has 12 chances to guess the word one letter at a time.
The "Hangman" Game started off as a project for me to learn and practice JavaScript and menipulating the DOM. After seeing the joy my friends and family got while playing the game, it turned into a game for them to play during their break, and something to help them master the spelling of words and even, at times, learn new ones. The game now lives somewhere in a fun and enlighten place.

Struggles: 

Connecting my clues and hint to interact with there categories.
Creating the Actual body and frame of the hangman and the process it takes through css and a array function.

Accomplished: 

A sense of fulfillment and what it's truly feels like to becoming a Developer and building a App on the web.
Having been my first web application been created, taught me that Pseudocode coding is very critical, before starting to write any line of code.

Game Interface
Blank spaces are displayed on the screen equal to the length of the word chosen randomly from a list. A category is given to the player to choose from. Player can guess a letter by pressing a keyboard key. If the letter is present in the word, the blank spaces are replaced with the letter at the right position. If the letter occurs more than once in the word, each occurence of the letter is replaced for a correct guess.

A letter can be guessed only once and for each wrong guess, the chances are decreased by 1 and hangman image is drawn on the canvas part by part till all the twelve chances are used up.

A new word is chosen after a successful game or after 12 guesses are up. Also, the player can choose a new word using the Next Word button.

Improvements if having more Developer experience:
Adding sounds to each button clicked.
Playing a sound if player gets the game right.
Also adding a second player to the game.
