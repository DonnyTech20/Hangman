# Hangman

The "Hangman" Game started off as a project for me to learn and practice JavaScript and menipulating the DOM. After seeing the joy my friends and family got while playing the game, it turned into a game for them to play during their break, and something to help them master the spelling of words and even, at times, learn new ones. The game now lives somewhere in a fun and enlighten place.
